# Discord Minefield Bot

## What is it?
Discord Minefield is a Discord bot that allows you to play Python-coded games on Discord!
And yes, we code ourselves the games!

**Current games on the bot:**
- Minesweeper
  - Spoiler version (the one that you see everywhere on Discord)
  - Interactive version (send tile coordinates, reveal tiles, flag tiles, win and lose, just like a **true minesweeper game**!)
- Catch the Wumpus (Hunt the Wumpus but we replaced violence with a lost Wumpus)
- More coming soon!

N.B.: Minesweeper Interactive version is currently in beta and can have some bugs. We're working on the code to squash as many bugs as we can.

## Can I add it on my server?
Not now. We wait until the end of Hack Week before the bot gets public to anyone.


## What are the commands?
They are listed below

**Games command**:
- `ms.minesweeper [amount of mines]` -> Start a Minesweeper game and generates a grid with \[amount of mines]

**Other commands**:
- `ms.game_rules [game]` -> See the rules of a game. If the game is not given, will show all the games available on the bot.
- `ms.help [command]` -> Shows the list of commands, as well as syntax and aliases, including the help of help command (usefulness = 0.00000000000000000001%)
- `ms.credits` or `ms.about` -> Shows info about the bot and its creators. *Seriously, does anyone read this?*
